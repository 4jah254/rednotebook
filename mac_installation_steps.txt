Successful Pip installations:
i) pip install pycairo
ii) Run the command: export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/libffi/lib/pkgconfig" and pip install PyGObject


After installing libffi, ran the following command in bashrc.
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/libffi/lib/pkgconfig"
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="${PKG_CONFIG_PATH}:/usr/local/opt/libffi/lib/pkgconfig"
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/libffi/lib/pkgconfig" pip install PyGObject

icu4c is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS provides libicucore.dylib (but nothing else).

If you need to have icu4c first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/icu4c/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/icu4c/sbin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find icu4c you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/icu4c/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/icu4c/include"

For pkg-config to find icu4c you may need to set:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/icu4c/lib/pkgconfig"
